# Movie Recommendation Engine
- This recommendation engine uses Python 3.7 and Neo4J 4.0.2.

- The main class is main.py and a Neo4J server should be running on your server.

- The configuration is stored in python files named "Configure". There is currently 2 files : one for IMDb and one for Neo4J

## Functionality
The POC uses the capabilities of graph databases.

## Data source
The source for the data is IMDb. Data available at https://datasets.imdbws.com

## TODO
- Algorithm based on other users ratings
- Algorithm using the rating (if the user liked the movie or not)
- Use of Flask or Django
- Create a Front-end
- Use a document Database (like elasticsearch) for the search, store data...
- Enable the movie search with typo
